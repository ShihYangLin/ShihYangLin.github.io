## Working Papers

### The Labor Supply of Married Women and Spousal Tax Deductions in Japan
with Minchung Hsu, Pei-Ju Liao, and Yi-Chan Tsai

Population aging results in the problem of labor shortage. The labor force of Japanese females presents a solution to the Japanese government. Despite measures to improve the female labor force participation rate, encouraging women to work more or even shift from part-time jobs to full-time jobs was considered by the government. This study employs a standard incomplete markets model (or the Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari style model) with heterogeneous households to examine the impact of two tax reforms (2004 and 2018) and a counterfactual reform abolishing spousal deduction on women's employment. Findings indicate that reducing spousal deduction after the 2004 tax reform boosts labor participation due to negative wealth effects, while the 2018 income threshold extensions result in a shift from full-time to part-time employment. Conversely, completely abolishing spousal deduction encourages a shift from part-time to full-time employment.

### A Two-Stage Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood Method for Poisson Models with Two Binary Endogenous Explanatory Variables
with Chingmu Chen, Shin-Kun Peng, and Wen-Jen Tsay

This paper introduces a novel estimator for the Poisson model with dual binary endogenous explanatory variables, addressing the need to quantify the effects of preferential economic integration agreements. We develop a two-stage pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator and derive analytical gradient matrices as well as Hessian matrices. These exact formulas improve computational speed significantly. Applying our approach to trade data, we find that preferential trade agreements have a positive impact on bilateral trade flows, while bilateral investment treaties have a negative effect. Additionally, the positive interaction term between these two treaties suggests that preferential trade agreements promote horizontal foreign direct investment.

### Robust Inference for Interrupted Time Series Models with Serial Dependent Disturbances  
with Wen-Jen Tsay and Hsin-Chieh Wong

This paper considers inference problems related to the widely known interrupted time series (ITS) model, which is used as a quasi-experimental approach for evaluating policy intervention effects over time. Under a single-treatment-group design with serially correlated errors, we are the first to establish the asymptotic distribution of the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators, which involves Brownian motion functionals and reveals a superconsistency property for the trending variables when the estimation error of the OLS estimator relative to the true coefficients is properly rescaled. Interestingly, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the rescaled estimator is proved to be invertible, even though the convergence rates of the OLS estimator for the level and trending variables differ, and the trending variables have different observation lengths. We further develop a studentized sieve bootstrap procedure and establish its asymptotic validity, providing an implementable inference method for small samples. In simulation experiments, the proposed bootstrap-based inference performs well, particularly under strong serial dependence.

### Estimating Count Data Models with <i>k</i> Endogenous Switching Variables

This paper proposes a novel approach to address the estimation and inference problems concerning the count data models featuring <i>k</i> binary endogenous explanatory variables. The proposed estimator fills the gap in various economic domains where discussions involve endogenous dummy variables (treatment effects) and sample selection. Under the correct model specification the full information maximum likelihood approach to estimation is introduced. Additionally, we develop both a one-stage quasi-maximum likelihood estimator and a two-stage quasi-maximum likelihood estimator to offer relatively robust alternatives.

### Empirical Relevance of Collateral-based and Cash Flow-based Credit Constraints in the U.S. Economy

This study explores the significance of cash flow-based borrowing constraints, testing their empirical relevance across various settings. It investigates whether these constraints can explain key features of U.S. economic data, such as the lead-lag relationship and volatility of residential and nonresidential investments. The study also compares cash flow-based constraints with asset-based counterparts to determine which is more empirically relevant. Finally, it examines the primary driving force behind the Great Recession, focusing on the impacts of deteriorating credit conditions on households and firms. The aim is to provide a clearer understanding of the main factors responsible for the downturn, informing future policy decisions.
